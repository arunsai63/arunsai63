### Solutions Architect | Full Stack | DevOps | Blockchain | AWS

</div>

Iâ€™m a Broad-Scoped Tech Generalist and Solutions Architect with 7+ years of experience in full-stack development, AWS cloud, DevOps, and blockchain. At Echor Tech, I lead the engineering team, where I architect scalable backend systems, manage end-to-end infrastructure, and oversee product delivery for high-impact projects.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve built and scaled platforms that have reached tens of thousands of users and crypto projects with a combined market cap exceeding $50M. Alongside hands-on architecture and engineering, Iâ€™ve been responsible for establishing core workflows, mentoring developers, and builing teams from the ground up.
